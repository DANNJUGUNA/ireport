Ireport is an application designed to facilitate communication between citizens and authorities regarding potential issues in their community. With Ireport, users can easily post redflags or interventions related to things like public safety, infrastructure, or other concerns. The platform allows users to provide detailed information about the issue, including photos and location data.
